# The-intelligent-journal
A good understanding of human emotions is essential in the context of identifying, treating, and keeping track of psychological issues. There is extensive research in terms of emotion detection through video, audio or pictures, and less when it comes to text input, despite the amount of data available publicly. Taking this into consideration, this paper presents an application which consists of a journal capable of extracting subjective information from the input given by the user, keeping track of their progress and making recommendations based on a rule system.  Furthermore, it aims to test the application on public journals in order to observe the evolution of people with depression issues and demonstrate the effect of keeping a journal to one's mental health.
